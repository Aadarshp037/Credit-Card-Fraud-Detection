# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning–based system to detect fraudulent credit card
transactions using historical transaction data. The objective is to identify anomalous
transactions while minimizing false positives, which is critical in real-world financial
systems.

---

## Aim
To build a data-driven fraud detection model that:
- Analyzes historical transaction patterns
- Identifies potentially fraudulent transactions
- Demonstrates the application of machine learning for anomaly detection

---

## Problem Statement
Credit card fraud poses a significant financial risk and requires automated detection
mechanisms capable of identifying suspicious transactions in large volumes of data.

Traditional rule-based systems are often insufficient, making machine learning approaches
essential for capturing complex fraud patterns.

---

## Approach

The system follows a standard machine learning workflow:

1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Feature scaling and transformation
3. Model training using supervised learning techniques
4. Evaluation using appropriate performance metrics
5. Fraud prediction on unseen transactions

The focus is on explainable and reproducible modeling rather than black-box optimization.

## Dataset Information
Due to GitHub file size limitations, the complete dataset is not stored directly in this
repository.

- A representative **sample dataset** is included for demonstration and reproducibility.
- The sample preserves the original feature structure and class imbalance characteristics.
- The full dataset can be accessed from the original source:
